## LuckFactor

The Ultimate Luck Test Game. 


![ts](https://badgen.net/badge/Built%20With/TypeScript/blue)

A simple lucky draw game. The players are can pick any number from the range (1 to 9) and they will get 3 chances to pick from a set of 9 tiles.

This is an Android as well as iOS game developed in __React Native__. 

######  Check the Mobile App Screenshots [here](./screenshots/README.md).

The project is developed using the following libraries and framework: 

- __React Native__ for the cross platform mobile application support.

- __Tailwind CSS__ for quickly designing UI components for the mobile app including buttons, flexbox and more.

- __Redux__ for managing state and having an open scope for scalability.

- __TypeScript__ to write more readable and type-safe code.

## Installation 

To install the project make sure you have `nodejs` and `react-native` installed.

- Clone this GitHub repository
- Use `yarn` or `npm i` to fetch all the packages and dependencies
- For running on Android, use `yarn android` and similarly for iOS use `yarn ios`

## Future Scope
The game is right now quick play mode i.e. it hardly takes a minute to try the complete game.

But in future the following things can be improved:
- More Animations can be added to components
- Add support for landscape mode & larger grid sizes
- Assets like images & game icon could be added
- Game can be scaled upto a complete element matching game in grid but the core idea would  be still related to Luck.
